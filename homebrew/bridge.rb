# Installed from the GitHub release binaries produced by
# .github/workflows/release.yml (inline `bun build --compile`; the artifact
# naming layout matches scripts/package-release.mjs exactly).
#
# NOTE: `version` below is pinned BY HAND as part of the release checklist
# (see RELEASE.md). The release workflow's guard job fails the release if
# this value drifts from the pushed vX.Y.Z tag.
#
# Local tap layout (for testing):
#   brew tap-new <user>/bridge
#   cp homebrew/bridge.rb $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/<user>/homebrew-bridge/
#   brew install <user>/bridge/bridge

  # Release checklist: bump to the tag version (and pin the sha256 lines
  # below) when cutting a release — the workflow guard asserts this equals
  # the pushed tag.

  # sha256 is :no_check until the release checklist step replaces it with
  # the real digest for that target, taken from the release's
  # `checksums-sha256.txt` (the workflow uploads it next to the binaries).
