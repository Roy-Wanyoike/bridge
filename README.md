# Bridge

[![CI](https://github.com/Roy-Wanyoike/bridge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Roy-Wanyoike/bridge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **One contract. Every language. Zero interoperability drift.**

## The problem

If your stack spans more than one language, you live this: the same data contract — `Payment`, `PaymentStatus`, the rule that currency is exactly 3 characters — is hand-implemented in Go, re-implemented in TypeScript, re-implemented again in Python. Nothing keeps those copies in sync. A "harmless" field rename ships, and three weeks later a consumer in another runtime discovers it in production. Breaking-change checks, where they exist at all, are per-tool and per-format: a linter for your proto files, a differ for your OpenAPI specs — and nothing that knows *who consumes what*.

## The solution

Bridge is a polyglot contract compiler and compatibility platform. You define data and service contracts once in the Bridge IDL. The compiler produces a canonical, hashable IR and from it:

- **generates** idiomatic, dependency-free Go / Rust / TypeScript / Python / Java / C# — types, enums, tagged unions, service clients, event envelopes — with **runtime validators for every constraint**, so the same rules are enforced in every runtime, not just one;
- **detects breaking changes** before they ship: `bridge diff` classifies every change SAFE / WARNING / BREAKING / UNKNOWN against the IR, and `bridge check` fails your pipeline (strict mode fails undecidable changes too — never silently safe);
- **governs contracts** in a content-addressed registry: SHA-256 identity, immutable versions, tamper detection, and a dependency graph (`dependents`, `dependencies`) so impact analysis becomes a query, not archaeology.

Real commands, real output — from the [runnable examples](examples/):

```console
$ bridge validate payments.bridge
✓ payments.bridge ok (package payments.v1, hash 1f7292582f39)

$ bridge generate payments.bridge --language go
✓ wrote generated/go/enums.go
✓ wrote generated/go/go.mod
✓ wrote generated/go/roundtrip_test.go
✓ wrote generated/go/services.go
✓ wrote generated/go/types.go
✓ wrote generated/go/validate.go
6 file(s) written to generated/go (go)

$ bridge diff v1.payments.bridge v2.payments.bridge
BRIDGE COMPATIBILITY REPORT
package: payments.v1

❌ Breaking: Field renamed: Payment.currency → Payment.reference
⚠ Added enum value: PaymentStatus.REFUNDED

Summary: 0 safe, 1 warnings, 1 breaking, 0 unknown
Verdict: BREAKING
Compatibility: FAILED
```

That last one is the point: the rename a code reviewer would wave through fails the report — and `bridge check` (the CI form) exits non-zero so it never merges. Generated output is byte-deterministic: regenerating never produces diff churn, and a contract's hash is its identity.

## Why it matters

- **One contract, N languages — by compiler, not by discipline.** Hand-maintained bindings and per-language validators are where drift enters. Bridge generates all six languages and the validators from one IR, so parity is enforced, not hoped for.
- **Breaking changes are caught at merge time, with honest classification.** Checks are built into the compiler (not bolted onto a spec parser), deterministic, and conservative — an undecidable change is reported as UNKNOWN and fails the default gate.
- **The registry answers the question no other tool can:** "who consumes this contract, and what does this change do to them?" Content-addressed, immutable, with a real dependency graph — one registry for your services, events, and APIs, not one per wire format.
- **Built for the AI-agent era.** Agents calling typed tools are just more consumers of contracts. Bridge's constraint parity, deterministic hashing, and compatibility gates apply to machine-to-machine and model-to-tool surfaces the same way they apply to your Go and Python services.

The nine packages behind this diagram (`bridge-core`, `bridge-compat`,
`bridge-generators`, `bridge-registry`, `bridge-cli`, `bridge-lsp`,
`bridge-serialization`, `bridge-registry-service`, `bridge-ffi`)
communicate only through the frozen IR — details in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Language support

Every target below is generated from the same IR — types, enums, tagged unions, aliases, constraint validators, service clients/traits, and event envelopes:

| Language | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Go       | ✅ Shipped | stdlib only; `encoding/json` tags; validator methods |
| Rust     | ✅ Shipped | serde; `@pattern` limitations documented |
| TypeScript | ✅ Shipped | strict types; documented `int64` (2^53) caveat |
| Python   | ✅ Shipped | stdlib dataclasses; `to_dict`/`from_dict` round-trip |
| Java     | ✅ Shipped | JDK-only (zero deps, incl. a generated JSON runtime); Maven project file |
| C#       | ✅ Shipped | System.Text.Json only; .csproj; structural value equality |
| WASM     | ✅ Shipped | via `@bridge/ffi` (`wasm32` cdylib + wasm-bindgen types with `fromJson`/`toJson`/`validate` from JS) — not a `bridge generate --language` target |

Every generated language is compile-verified in CI against the runnable
examples, and every generated package ships a round-trip test. The FFI
layer additionally carries **service methods** across the boundary —
see [docs/FFI.md](docs/FFI.md).

## Status

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roy-Wanyoike/bridge.git
cd bridge
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

Requires Node.js >= 22. The test suite covers all nine packages (669 tests: compiler, generators, compat + impact, serialization, local registry, registry service, FFI, LSP, CLI); the `scripts/verify-*.sh` files additionally type-check and round-trip the generated code for every example, including the Java and C# targets.
